# Quantum-Supers Control System (QS_CTRL)

A cutting-edge, cinematic dashboard designed for the simulation and management of quantum computing operations and temporal navigation ("Quantum Leap" scenarios). This application blends technical telemetry with narrative-driven AI to create an immersive "Command Center" experience.

## 🌌 Features

### 1. Quantum Telemetry & Real-time Metrics
- **Live Feed**: Fluctuating data streams for Entanglement Levels, Coherence Time, Gate Operations, and Quantum Noise.
- **Dynamic Indicators**: Visual health statuses (Optimal, Warning, Critical) for core hardware components.
- **Critical Alert System**: Automated visual triggers (shaking, flashing, red-shift) when noise levels exceed safety thresholds.

### 2. Temporal Leap Engine (AI-Powered)
- **Narrative Generation**: Uses the **Gemini 3 Flash** model to generate dramatic, cinematic mission logs based on target dates and system stability.
- **Stability Analysis**: Real-time predictive analysis of timeline divergence risks using quantum state data.
- **Navigation Console**: Precision control for coordinate input and "Quantum Power Steering" to stabilize dimensional manifolds.

### 3. Qubit Matrix Laboratory
- **State Visualizer**: Interactive SVG-based visualization of 8-qubit registers showing probability distributions and phase rotations.
- **Hardware Diagnostics**: Low-level monitoring of vacuum pressure, coolant levels, and photon yields.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 (ESM-native), Tailwind CSS.
- **Icons**: Lucide React for high-fidelity iconography.
- **AI Integration**: `@google/genai` (Google Gemini API).
- **Architecture**: Modular component structure with centralized state management for simulation data.

## 🤖 AI Integration Details

The system leverages the `gemini-3-flash-preview` model for two critical functions:
- **`generateTemporalLog`**: Transforms raw data and dates into professional sci-fi narratives.
- **`analyzeQuantumStability`**: Performs structured data analysis to return JSON-formatted divergence risks and mission advisories.

## 🎨 Aesthetic Principles

- **Glassmorphism**: High-blur backdrops with subtle borders.
- **Cyber-Blue Palette**: Primary sky-400/500 palette with amber/red overlays for alert states.
- **Mono Typography**: JetBrains Mono for a professional, technical "developer" feel.
