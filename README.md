# Quantum-Superscript Control System (QS_CTRL)

A cutting-edge, cinematic dashboard designed for the simulation and management of quantum computing operations and temporal navigation ("Quantum Leap" scenarios). This application blends technical telemetry with narrative-driven AI to create an immersive "Command Center" experience.

## 🌌 Features

### 1. Quantum Telemetry & Real-time Metrics
- **Live Feed**: Fluctuating data streams for Entanglement Levels, Coherence Time, Gate Operations, and Quantum Noise.
- **Dynamic Indicators**: Visual health statuses (Optimal, Warning, Critical) for core hardware components.
- **Critical Alert System**: Automated visual triggers (shaking, flashing, red-shift) when noise levels exceed safety thresholds.

### 2. System Properties (คุณสมบัติของระบบควบคุม)
- **High-Fidelity Thai Support**: Detailed technical specifications provided in both English and Thai for localized mission control.
- **QS_Engine Architecture**: Deep dive into the fractal qubit topology and cryogenic cooling arrays.
- **AI Security & Governance**: Advanced neural safeguards based on the 2025 AI Governance Framework (ISO-2025-AI) to prevent model poisoning and unauthorized timeline drift.

### 3. Temporal Leap Engine (AI-Powered)
- **Narrative Generation**: Uses the **Gemini 3 Flash** model to generate dramatic, cinematic mission logs.
- **Stability Analysis**: Real-time predictive analysis of timeline divergence risks using **Gemini 3 Pro** for complex reasoning.
- **Navigation Console**: Precision control for coordinate input and "Quantum Power Steering" to stabilize dimensional manifolds.

### 4. Ziggy Neural Interface
- **Native Audio Integration**: Real-time, low-latency voice link using the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio** model.
- **Status Telemetry**: Hands-free system reporting and haptic feedback diagnostics via a conversational AI interface.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 (ESM-native), Tailwind CSS.
- **Icons**: Lucide React for high-fidelity iconography.
- **AI Integration**: `@google/genai` (Google Gemini API).
- **Security**: Hardened "Neural Shield" v4.0 with SAST scanning and EthicalCheck compliance.

## 🤖 AI Integration Details

The system leverages multiple Gemini models for specialized tasks:
- **`gemini-3-flash-preview`**: Drives the `generateTemporalLog` for professional sci-fi narrative construction.
- **`gemini-3-pro-preview`**: Powers the `analyzeQuantumStability` module for high-stakes STEM/Quantum reasoning and JSON-formatted risk prediction.
- **`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview`**: Facilitates the **Ziggy Neural Interface**, providing human-like spoken responses and real-time audio telemetry.

## 🎨 Aesthetic Principles

- **Glassmorphism**: High-blur backdrops with subtle borders.
- **Cyber-Blue Palette**: Primary sky-400/500 palette with amber/red overlays for alert states.
- **Mono Typography**: JetBrains Mono for a professional, technical "developer" feel.
