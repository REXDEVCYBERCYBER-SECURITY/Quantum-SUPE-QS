# Security Policy: QS_CTRL Neural Safeguards

## 🛡️ Commitment to Dimensional Integrity

At the Quantum-Superscript Control System (QS_CTRL), maintaining the security of our temporal manifolds and sub-register registers is our highest priority. We recognize that vulnerabilities in the neural link or quantum steering protocols could lead to catastrophic timeline divergence.

## 🚀 Supported Versions

The following versions of the Quantum-Superscript Control System are currently receiving active security patches and neural fortification updates:

| Version | Status | Neural Shielding Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| v2.5.x | ✅ Supported | AES-QUBIT 2048-BIT |
| v2.0.x | ⚠️ Legacy Support | AES-QUBIT 1024-BIT |
| < v2.0 | ❌ End of Life | DEPRECATED |

## 📡 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability—whether it be a sub-space packet collision, a leak in the cryogenic coolant encryption, or an unauthorized bypass of the Ziggy Neural Interface—please do not initiate a public log.

Instead, follow these protocols:

1.  **Encrypted Dispatch**: Send a detailed report of the anomaly to `security@quantum-superscript.io`.
2.  **Telemetry Data**: Include steps to reproduce the breach, the specific component affected (e.g., Qubit Lab, Steering Manifold), and any relevant console logs.
3.  **Containment**: Allow our team 72 temporal hours to evaluate the risk and deploy a neural patch before discussing the vulnerability with other travelers.

## 🔍 Continuous Fortification

QS_CTRL utilizes automated security protocols including:
- **EthicalCheck**: Continuous API security testing to prevent unauthorized sub-space access.
- **Fortify SAST**: Static analysis of neural pathways to ensure code integrity before leap deployment.
